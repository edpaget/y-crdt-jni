  - Kotlin interop tests verifying prosemirror-kotlin integration
  - Ready for Phase 1 implementation (PM â†” Y-CRDT conversion)

### Fixed
- Critical bug in `encodeStateAsUpdate()` - now encodes against empty state vector for correct synchronization
- Architecture unification - YXmlElement and YXmlText now use direct XmlElementRef/XmlTextRef pointers consistently across both root-level and child retrieval APIs

## [0.1.0] - TBD

### Added
- Initial release
- YDoc support with full CRDT operations
- YText support for collaborative text editing

- YXmlElement support for collaborative XML elements with attributes
- Multi-platform native libraries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- JAR distribution with embedded native libraries
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
